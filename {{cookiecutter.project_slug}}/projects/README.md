# Project-Specific Conventions

This directory contains conventions specific to individual projects you work on.

## Usage

Create a subdirectory for each project:

```
projects/
├── my-webapp/
│   ├── build.md      # Build commands and workflows
│   └── context.md    # Project structure and purpose
└── my-cli-tool/
    └── patterns.md   # Project-specific patterns
```

These will be automatically loaded when working in those project directories.
