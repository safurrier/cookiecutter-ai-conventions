# Testing Conventions

Apply these patterns when writing or modifying tests.

## Convention Source
@domains/testing/core.md

## Quick Reference

### Test Organization
- Use pytest, not unittest
- Progressive testing: E2E → Smoke → Integration → Unit
- One test file per source file
- Group related tests in classes

### Test Patterns
```python
def test_behavior_when_condition(self):
    """Test that behavior occurs when condition is met."""
    # Arrange
    
    # Act
    
    # Assert
```

### Fixtures
- Use fixtures for setup, not setUp methods
- Scope fixtures appropriately (function, class, module, session)
- Name fixtures descriptively

## Examples

Good test:
```python
def test_user_creation_with_valid_email(db_session):
    """Test that users can be created with valid email."""
    # Arrange
    email = "user@example.com"
    
    # Act
    user = User.create(email=email)
    
    # Assert
    assert user.id is not None
    assert user.email == email
```
