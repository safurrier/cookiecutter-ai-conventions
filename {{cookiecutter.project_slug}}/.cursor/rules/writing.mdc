# Writing Conventions

Apply these patterns for documentation, comments, and technical writing.

## Convention Source
@domains/writing/core.md

## Quick Reference

### Documentation
- Start with the problem, not the solution
- Use concrete examples
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Active voice

### Code Comments
- Explain why, not what
- Document edge cases
- Keep comments up to date

### Commit Messages
@domains/writing/commit-messages.md

### PR Descriptions
@domains/writing/pr-summaries.md

## Examples

Good documentation:
```markdown

\```

```

Bad documentation:
```markdown
## Rate Limiting

This module implements rate limiting functionality.
